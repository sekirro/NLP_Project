We should ideally not think of your two problems (poor erections and bladder muscle weakness) as separate entities and should check if one solution will help both problems. There are other investigations which can also be performed. These include a penile Doppler to test vascularity of your phallus. You can also be tried with medications like alpha-blockers to see if urine flow improves, and if required also add medication to improve bladder muscle tone which unfortunately is not very often successful.

Based on the information provided, it seems you are motivated to give up this addiction as you appear to understand the fact that it is hurting your body physically.

During this process, you might experience significant restlessness and anxiety. If you are motivated enough and know relaxation techniques, try to be in this situation for approximately 90 minutes or when you feel your anxiety is wearing off without any additional help.
