"垂体大腺瘤的治疗方法有哪些，现27，年底28岁
未婚，未生育，之前月经正常，第一次来是12岁，比较规律，每月大概会规律的缩后1个星期，大概5天左右，有少数时候时间长些，最长时可能十天左右，当时吃了我妈泡的解热的中草药，大概从2008年1月左右，到现在2009年8月停经一年半多点，2009年3月（大约，记不太清了）月经来了一点，有来的迹象，后又没有了。",从提供的病史看，垂体催乳素瘤诊断明确，并且较大，有局部压迫的症状出现，要尽早治疗，治疗方案上，先服用溴隐停是首选，可使症状减轻，瘤体缩小，到时再考虑是否手术，或继续服药。个人认为放疗不作为首选，如行放疗，若无效或复发，将失去手术机会，并造成垂体低功，闭经不能生育。因此，可以先用溴隐停，剂量可以大一点，从一片开始加到每天6片，使症状得到控制再减量，用药期间注意低血压和胃肠道反应,"

Your problem seems to be a very rare kind of addiction.  Based on the information provided, it seems you are motivated to give up this addiction as you appear to understand the fact that it is hurting your body physically. It seems that you are struggling psychologically as well. I guess first and foremost, you should get yourself checked physically as raw rice can cause some physical issues and some problems of menstruation could be due to other unrelated/related issues. An opinion from physician or gynecologist might be helpful. Next comes the issue of addiction. I suppose one method could be to use Exposure and response prevention strategy. The basic principle would be to expose you to raw rice which will possibly induce the desire to eat it and then have someone stop you from eating it. During this process, you might experience significant restlessness and anxiety. If you are motivated enough and know relaxation techniques, try to be in this situation for approximately 90 minutes or when you feel your anxiety is wearing off without any additional help. You will realize that gradually the intensity of your craving is reducing and after sometimes start doing it yourself. You can take the help of a clinical psychologist in this process. The role of medication would be very limited. However, I believe consulting a psychiatrist to explore other psychological issues (if any) can be of further benefit. Hope this will be of some help.

Hi, I am sorry to hear about your son. It sounds like he is having some problems with his teeth and gums. The most common cause of loose tooth in children is tooth decay (cavities). This can be treated by filling the cavity and giving him fluoride treatment. Another possibility is gum infection which may require antibiotics. However, the best way to find out what is going on is for your child to visit an oral surgeon who will examine his mouth and do x-rays if necessary. Hope this helps.  Chat Doctor.
