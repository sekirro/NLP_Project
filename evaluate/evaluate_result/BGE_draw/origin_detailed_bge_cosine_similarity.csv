什么是子宫内膜单纯性增生，无
assistant
子宫内膜单纯性增生是一种常见的妇科疾病，主要发生在育龄期女性中。它是指子宫内膜在激素（主要是雌激素）的作用下过度生长，但没有出现非典型性的细胞变化。这种情况下，子宫内膜的细胞形态和结构相对保持正常。

子宫内膜单纯性增生的原因可能与体内雌激素水平过高有关，而孕激素水平相对不足，导致子宫内膜不能得到充分的“抑制”，从而引起增生。这种情况可能会增加子宫内膜癌的风险，因此需要医生的评估和治疗建议。

Your problem seems to be a very rare kind of addiction.  Based on the information provided, it seems you are motivated to give up this addiction as you appear to understand the fact that it is hurting your body physically.

An opinion from physician or gynecologist might be helpful. Next comes the issue of addiction. I suppose one method could be to use Exposure and response prevention strategy. The basic principle would be to expose you to raw rice which will possibly induce the desire to eat it and then have someone stop you from eating it. During this process, you might experience significant restlessness and anxiety. If you are motivated enough and know relaxation techniques, try to be in this situation for approximately 90 minutes or when you feel your anxiety is wearing off without any additional help. You will realize that gradually the intensity of your craving is reducing and after sometimes start doing it yourself. You can take the help of a clinical psychologist in this process.
