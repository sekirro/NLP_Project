前列腺癌有哪些原因造成的，我父亲09年实施前列腺癌根治术，术后发觉已骨转移，后用间歇内分泌双得疗法，坚持了5年，一直有效，今年73岁。2个半月前打两次针，第一个月后PSA为4（以前第二针通常降为1或2），第三月没仔细检查（父亲固执不想去）。最近一个月父亲食欲不振，前晚骨盆睡不着，但白天昨晚又不痛了。父亲性格开朗，身体条件较好，重视生活质量，坚决不同意放射治疗，化疗方法。在乎怎样的帮助：前列腺癌有哪些原因引发的,1、年龄因素：年纪越大，再次发生前列腺癌的机会也就越高。2、隔代遗传因素：血亲中有前列腺癌的人，得前列腺癌的机会就比一般人高；换句话说，约有9%的前列腺癌患者有家族病史。3、荷尔蒙因素：绝大多数的前列腺癌细胞表面有男性荷尔蒙的接受器，而丧失男性荷尔蒙的刺激，前列腺癌细胞就会膨胀萎缩。,"
前列腺癌是一种常见的男性生殖系统恶性肿瘤，其主要原因是与遗传因素、环境因素和生活习惯有关。其中，遗传因素是最重要的原因之一，尤其是家族中有前列腺癌病史的人群患病风险更高。此外，环境污染、饮食习惯、吸烟饮酒等不良生活方式也是导致前列腺癌的重要因素。
建议您及时带父亲到医院复诊，根据病情决定合适的治疗方案。如果目前病情稳定，可以采用保守治疗，如药物控制症状，提高生活质量；如果病情进展较快，则需要考虑手术治疗或其他治疗方法。同时，注意调整饮食结构，避免高脂肪、高热量的食物，多吃蔬菜水果",0.0

Since you had a total thyroidectomy in 2010, it will help to know the scan findings in the post-operative thyroid bed and know if there is any suspicious malignant process going on.

您好，根据您的描述来看，单纯性增生是由于体内雌激素分泌过多引起的。子宫内膜增生是一种常见的妇科疾病，多发生于育龄妇女，尤其是未生育过的女性。本病的发生与长期的雌激素刺激有关。如果治疗不及时或治疗不当，可发展为子宫内膜癌。子宫内膜增生的治疗原则是去除病因，调整内分泌平衡，防止癌变。根据患者年龄、临床症状、病变程度和是否有生育要求等综合考虑，选择适当的治疗方法。子宫内膜增生的治疗有药物治疗和手术治疗两种。药物治疗",0.0

Your problem seems to be a very rare kind of addiction.  Based on the information provided, it seems you are motivated to give up this addiction as you appear to understand the fact that it is hurting your body physically. It seems that you are struggling psychologically as well. I guess first and foremost, you should get yourself checked physically as raw rice can cause some physical issues and some problems of menstruation could be due to other unrelated/related issues. An opinion from physician or gynecologist might be helpful. Next comes the issue of addiction. I suppose one method could be to use Exposure and response prevention strategy. The basic principle would be to expose you to raw rice which will possibly induce the desire to eat it and then have someone stop you from eating it. During this process, you might experience significant restlessness and anxiety. If you are motivated enough and know relaxation techniques, try to be in this situation for approximately 90 minutes or when you feel your anxiety is wearing off without any additional help. You will realize that gradually the intensity of your craving is reducing and after sometimes start doing it yourself. You can take the help of a clinical psychologist in this process. The role of medication would be very limited. However, I believe consulting a psychiatrist to explore other psychological issues (if any) can be of further benefit. Hope this will be of some help.
