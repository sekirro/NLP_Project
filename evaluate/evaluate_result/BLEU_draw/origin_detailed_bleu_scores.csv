Based on the information provided, it seems you are motivated to give up this addiction as you appear to understand the fact that it is hurting your body physically.

An opinion from physician or gynecologist might be helpful. Next comes the issue of addiction. I suppose one method could be to use Exposure and response prevention strategy. The basic principle would be to expose you to raw rice which will possibly induce the desire to eat it and then have someone stop you from eating it. During this process, you might experience significant restlessness and anxiety. If you are motivated enough and know relaxation techniques, try to be in this situation for approximately 90 minutes or when you feel your anxiety is wearing off without any additional help. You will realize that gradually the intensity of your craving is reducing and after sometimes start doing it yourself. You can take the help of a clinical psychologist in this process.

首先，恭喜您怀孕了。关于您的问题，HCV（即丙型肝炎病毒）检测结果为阳性意味着您感染了丙型肝炎。对于是否可以继续妊娠，需要综合考虑多个因素，包括您的健康状况、病毒载量、以及孕期的具体情况等。

玻璃体液化是一种常见的眼科疾病，通常随着年龄增长而发生。它是指眼睛中的玻璃体（一种透明凝胶状物质）逐渐液化和体积减少的过程，可能会导致一些视觉问题，如飞蚊症等。需要注意的是，玻璃体液化本身并不需要治疗，因为它通常是无症状的，或者其症状轻微到不需要特殊处理。

对于有症状的患者，治疗主要针对其引发的症状，比如视网膜脱落或视网膜裂孔的风险增加等。治疗方法可能包括激光治疗或手术干预来预防并发症的发生，而不是直接治疗玻璃体液化本身。
