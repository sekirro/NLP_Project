It is important to review your condition in detail with imaging findings. A 1 mm and 2 mm mass in lymph nodes is less likely to be a cancer.

Since you had a total thyroidectomy in 2010, it will help to know the scan findings in the post-operative thyroid bed and know if there is any suspicious malignant process going on. In the absence of a recent mass or lymph nodes of considerable size in the area it is difficult to call it a recurrent cancer.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi Vila, Thanks for trusting Chat Doctor with your query. Your problem seems to be a very rare kind of addiction.  Based on the information provided, it seems you are motivated to give up this addiction as you appear to understand the fact that it is hurting your body physically. It seems that you are struggling psychologically as well. I guess first and foremost, you should get yourself checked physically as raw rice can cause some physical issues and some problems of menstruation could be due to other unrelated/related issues. An opinion from physician or gynecologist might be helpful. Next comes the issue of addiction. I suppose one method could be to use Exposure and response prevention strategy. The basic principle would be to expose you to raw rice which will possibly induce the desire to eat it and then have someone stop you from eating it. During this process, you might experience significant restlessness and anxiety. If you are motivated enough and know relaxation techniques, try to be in this situation for approximately 90 minutes or when you feel your anxiety is wearing off without any additional help. You will realize that gradually the intensity of your craving is reducing and after sometimes start doing it yourself. You can take the help of a clinical psychologist in this process. The role of medication would be very limited. However, I believe consulting a psychiatrist to explore other psychological issues (if any) can be of further benefit. Hope this will be of some help.

1、体格检查：颈强直、克氏征阳性、布氏征阳性。2、实验室检查：血常规，腰穿，脑脊液化验。3、辅助检查：头颅CT或MRI，经颅多普勒超声等。4、鉴别诊断：(一)蛛网膜下腔出血：常有高血压病史，发病急骤，头痛剧烈，呕吐频繁，脑膜刺激征明显，腰椎穿刺压力增高，脑脊液呈均匀一致的血性，CT扫描可见脑底池和蛛网膜下腔内高密度出血影",0.0

Is it associated with fever? At what times the cough is more? If you have fever or flu like symptoms and your chest is clear on auscultation or x-ray chest, then it is most likely bronchitis for which you will need to take antibiotics.
