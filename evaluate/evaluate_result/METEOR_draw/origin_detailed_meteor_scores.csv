什么是子宫内膜单纯性增生，无

子宫内膜单纯性增生是一种常见的妇科疾病，主要指的是子宫内膜在没有明显炎症或恶性变化的情况下，由于某些原因导致的非典型增生。这种增生通常是良性的，但如果不加以治疗或者管理，有可能进展为更严重的病变。

子宫内膜单纯性增生的具体成因尚不完全清楚，但可能与激素水平失衡有关，尤其是雌激素水平过高而孕激素相对不足时，可能会促进子宫内膜过度生长。这种情况常见于青春期、生育年龄妇女以及绝经前期女性。

Based on the information provided, it seems you are motivated to give up this addiction as you appear to understand the fact that it is hurting your body physically.

The basic principle would be to expose you to raw rice which will possibly induce the desire to eat it and then have someone stop you from eating it. During this process, you might experience significant restlessness and anxiety. If you are motivated enough and know relaxation techniques, try to be in this situation for approximately 90 minutes or when you feel your anxiety is wearing off without any additional help.

在治疗霉菌性阴道炎期间，建议避免性生活，主要原因有以下几点：

1. **增加感染风险**：性生活可能会加重症状或导致感染扩散，从而延长治疗时间。
2. **交叉感染**：霉菌性阴道炎具有一定的传染性，尤其是在性生活中，可能会将病原体传给伴侣，或者从伴侣那里获得新的病原体。
3. **影响治疗效果**：性活动可能会破坏局部用药的效果，如干扰阴道内药物的吸收或分布，从而影响治疗效果。

当然，具体是否可以进行性生活还需要根据医生的具体指导和个人情况",0.0
