There are other investigations which can also be performed. These include a penile Doppler to test vascularity of your phallus.

It is important to review your condition in detail with imaging findings. A 1 mm and 2 mm mass in lymph nodes is less likely to be a cancer. These are too small to be told apart and can also be seen in many benign conditions. This requires clinical examination by a surgeon and correlation with your scan report. Since you had a total thyroidectomy in 2010, it will help to know the scan findings in the post-operative thyroid bed and know if there is any suspicious malignant process going on. In the absence of a recent mass or lymph nodes of considerable size in the area it is difficult to call it a recurrent cancer.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi Vila, Thanks for trusting Chat Doctor with your query. Your problem seems to be a very rare kind of addiction.  Based on the information provided, it seems you are motivated to give up this addiction as you appear to understand the fact that it is hurting your body physically. It seems that you are struggling psychologically as well. I guess first and foremost, you should get yourself checked physically as raw rice can cause some physical issues and some problems of menstruation could be due to other unrelated/related issues. An opinion from physician or gynecologist might be helpful. Next comes the issue of addiction. I suppose one method could be to use Exposure and response prevention strategy. The basic principle would be to expose you to raw rice which will possibly induce the desire to eat it and then have someone stop you from eating it. During this process, you might experience significant restlessness and anxiety. If you are motivated enough and know relaxation techniques, try to be in this situation for approximately 90 minutes or when you feel your anxiety is wearing off without any additional help. You will realize that gradually the intensity of your craving is reducing and after sometimes start doing it yourself. You can take the help of a clinical psychologist in this process. The role of medication would be very limited. However, I believe consulting a psychiatrist to explore other psychological issues (if any) can be of further benefit. Hope this will be of some help.

If you have fever or flu like symptoms and your chest is clear on auscultation or x-ray chest, then it is most likely bronchitis for which you will need to take antibiotics.  But if there is only cough which occurs at nighttime in bed, then it is most likely due to HERD, for which you will need to raise bed end, keep a gap of at least 2 hours between meal and going to bed and may need medication.
