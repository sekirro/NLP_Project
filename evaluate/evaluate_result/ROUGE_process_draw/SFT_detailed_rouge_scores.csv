It is important to review your condition in detail with imaging findings. A 1 mm and 2 mm mass in lymph nodes is less likely to be a cancer.

"If you are a doctor, please answer the medical questions based on the patient's description.","Hi Vila, Thanks for trusting Chat Doctor with your query. Your problem seems to be a very rare kind of addiction.  Based on the information provided, it seems you are motivated to give up this addiction as you appear to understand the fact that it is hurting your body physically. It seems that you are struggling psychologically as well. I guess first and foremost, you should get yourself checked physically as raw rice can cause some physical issues and some problems of menstruation could be due to other unrelated/related issues. An opinion from physician or gynecologist might be helpful. Next comes the issue of addiction. I suppose one method could be to use Exposure and response prevention strategy. The basic principle would be to expose you to raw rice which will possibly induce the desire to eat it and then have someone stop you from eating it. During this process, you might experience significant restlessness and anxiety. If you are motivated enough and know relaxation techniques, try to be in this situation for approximately 90 minutes or when you feel your anxiety is wearing off without any additional help. You will realize that gradually the intensity of your craving is reducing and after sometimes start doing it yourself. You can take the help of a clinical psychologist in this process. The role of medication would be very limited. However, I believe consulting a psychiatrist to explore other psychological issues (if any) can be of further benefit. Hope this will be of some help.

Hi, I understand your concern.  Your son has developed an infection in his ear which is known as Otitis Media. It is a common condition and it usually gets better with treatment.  In case of severe infections or infections which do not get better after 48-72 hours of treatment, a small tube may be placed to allow drainage of fluid from the middle ear. This will help in reducing pain and fever and improve hearing. Hope this helps. Regards Chat Doctor.

Hi, I understand your concern. The most common cause of pain in the back of the neck is a muscle spasm, which can be due to poor posture or stress. You may also have a disc problem, but this is less likely unless there is radiating pain down one arm or leg. If it is a muscle spasm, then the best treatment is rest and analgesics (such as paracetamol). A warm bath will also help relax the muscles. If the pain persists, then an x-ray may be necessary to rule out other causes such as arthritis. Hope this helps. Regards.

Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is important to know what kind of surgery was done and what is the current status of your health. If you have had surgery for cancer then it is possible that you may have developed lymphedema due to removal of lymph nodes. Lymphedema is swelling due to collection of lymph fluid in tissues. This can happen when lymph nodes are removed or damaged during surgery. In such cases, it is important to get evaluated by an oncologist and also by a physical therapist who specializes in lymphedema management. They will be able to help you with exercises and compression bandages to reduce swelling.
