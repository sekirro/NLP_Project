Based on the information provided, it seems you are motivated to give up this addiction as you appear to understand the fact that it is hurting your body physically.

An opinion from physician or gynecologist might be helpful. Next comes the issue of addiction. I suppose one method could be to use Exposure and response prevention strategy. The basic principle would be to expose you to raw rice which will possibly induce the desire to eat it and then have someone stop you from eating it. During this process, you might experience significant restlessness and anxiety. If you are motivated enough and know relaxation techniques, try to be in this situation for approximately 90 minutes or when you feel your anxiety is wearing off without any additional help. You will realize that gradually the intensity of your craving is reducing and after sometimes start doing it yourself. You can take the help of a clinical psychologist in this process.

### 小孩睡觉时抽搐是否是癫痫？

小孩在睡眠中出现短暂、轻微的抽搐可能并不一定意味着患有癫痫。这种情况有时被称为良性睡惊症或夜惊，通常在儿童成长过程中自然消失，不需要特殊治疗。然而，如果抽搐伴随其他症状（如意识丧失、反复发作等），或者家长对此感到担忧，建议及时就医进行专业评估，以排除癫痫或其他潜在的健康问题。

根据您描述的情况，孩子可能是因为过敏性咳嗽导致的喉咙有痰，且对常见的抗生素类药物（如头孢、阿莫西林等）过敏。这种情况下，处理起来需要谨慎，建议如下：

玻璃体液化的治愈率是多少？
assistant
玻璃体液化是一种常见的眼科状况，通常随着年龄的增长而发生。它指的是眼睛中的玻璃体（一种填充在眼球后部透明凝胶状物质）逐渐变得稀薄并可能形成液体区域。这种状况本身通常不需要治疗，除非伴随有视网膜脱落或其他并发症。

玻璃体液化并不是一个需要“治愈”的情况，而是自然老化过程的一部分。因此，没有具体的治愈率可以提供。对于那些因玻璃体液化而出现症状或并发症的患者，治疗方法会根据具体情况而定，如激光手术或玻璃体切割术等，用于处理视网膜脱落",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

在治疗霉菌性阴道炎期间，建议避免性生活。原因如下：

1. **增加感染风险**：性行为可能会导致霉菌进一步传播或加重炎症。
2. **影响治疗效果**：性生活可能会影响药物的使用效果，因为性活动可能导致局部药物分布不均，从而降低治疗效果。
3. **避免交叉感染**：霉菌性阴道炎有时会通过性接触传播给伴侣，这不仅增加了自身的治疗难度，还可能导致伴侣也出现类似症状。

当然，在特殊情况下，如紧急情况需要进行性生活时，应采取必要的预防措施，例如使用",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
